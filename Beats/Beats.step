# [Beat]
# States that a beat has just completed.  If we're just generating a story, this is a no-op.
# If we're playing interactively, it will pause the game until the players finish playing out
# the beat.

# This is also used by the profiler when it's looking for what beats have been used in a given
# playthrough.  Any task that calls Beat is considered by the profiler to be a beat.  So any
# such task that gets called in a playthough is a beat that was used in the playthrough.

Beat.  # no-op

# [StoryBeat ?task]
# ?task is a task that constitutes a story beat.
# By convention, all story beats end by calling [Beat] so StoryBeat just checks
# whether the task calls [Beat].
